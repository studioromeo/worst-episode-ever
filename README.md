## The scenario
You're one of the more experienced developers on a really tight project. One of your less experienced devs (Bob) is tasked with creating a login form for your brand new website. It took slightly longer than you were expecting to be ready but finally Bob raises a pull request for you to review.

You inspect Bobs work and while it passes all the criteria in the ticket you know it's not quite right and could do with improvement.

## The challenge
Bobs pull request has a mixture of issues ranging from codestyle errors to functional bugs.

Bob takes 10 minutes to resolve each comment raised but time is against you and you need to get this feature released within the hour. While you can ignore this deadline, doing so you wont complete the remaining features.

Your challenge is to pick the right amount of feedback to give Bob the best chance of completing his feature on time but retaining a level of quality in the codebase.

Good luck!

## How to enter
Head to the pull request and turn off comments. Then start commenting! Bob can fix a max of 6 issues in the deployment window otherwise you will run over.

## Why?
We often use code reviews to raise the quality of each others code. Most of the time however we don't have the luxury of being able to make each others code perfect. Deadlines, politics, morale all get in the way of this process and it's often a balancing act between quality and quantity.

This project is designed to make you think about the cost of leaving feedback and where you draw the line between the best and good enough. I'm interested to learn what feedback you prioritise and what you let slide, or maybe you let the project slide in order to keep the quality of the codebase high?

## In credit to Bob
This scenario is a bit extreme and really Bob would be best to have one on one mentoring for a while rather than being taught through a code review. I'm sure Bob's a great developer really.
